This is a News Content Management System (CMS) developed using PHP and MySQL. It allows administrators to manage news articles, categories, users, and website settings through an easy-to-use admin panel. The system supports secure login/logout, CRUD operations for posts and categories, dynamic image handling, and role-based access control.

Key Features:

**1) Add, edit, delete, & manage news posts -** Admins can create new news articles with title, description, category, and images.Existing posts can be updated or removed anytime.All posts are listed in the admin panel for easy management.

**2) Category management system -** Categories like National, International, Sports, Business etc. can be added, edited, or deleted. Posts are linked with categories for better organization. The system auto-updates post counts in each category.

**3) User management with roles (Admin/Normal User) -** Admin can add multiple users. Role-based access:Admin → Full control (posts, categories, users, settings). Normal User → Limited access (can manage only posts).

**4) Session-based authentication (secure login/logout) -** Users must log in with valid credentials. Sessions prevent unauthorized access to the admin panel. Secure logout ensures no one can access data after logging out.

**5) Website settings with dynamic logo and footer -** Admin can update website name, logo image and footer description. Both the logo and footer content update dynamically across the site without manual code changes.

**6) Upload & display post images -** Admin can upload images while creating or editing posts. Images are stored in an upload folder with unique names. Posts dynamically display images on the front end.
